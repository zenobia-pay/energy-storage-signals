To reach 50k target, need to: 1) Read full comment threads of all 45 posts (only read partial), 2) Expand to more subreddits (r/teslamotors, r/RealTesla, r/australia, r/climate, etc), 3) Follow user profiles to find additional content creators. Current extraction focused on commenters in energy storage discussions."
