# Catalyst: The Rise of Grid Power Electronics with Drew Baglino

**Host:** Shayle Kann (Energy Impact Partners)
**Guest:** Drew Baglino (Founder & CEO, Heron Power; former Tesla SVP)
**Date:** February 2026

## Key Topics
- Solid-state transformers (SSTs) and grid power electronics
- Silicon carbide power semiconductors
- History of power electronics development
- Replacing legacy grid infrastructure (transformers, switchgear)
- Solar/battery integration efficiency
- Data center power distribution

## Key Points
- Power electronics evolution: from vacuum tubes to silicon carbide
- SSTs can replace: legacy transformer, 690V breakers/fuses, power-factor-correcting capacitors
- 5-6% NPV uplift for customers using SST-based inverters vs alternatives
- Solar inverter availability ~97.5-98% (industry average)
- Transformers failing ~1-1.4% per year in desert solar plants
- Over 70% of distribution transformers are over 30 years old
- Heron Power raised $140M Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz

## Companies/People Mentioned
- Heron Power, Tesla, SMA, SunGrow, Huawei, Power Electronics, EPC Power
- Wolfspeed, Infineon (silicon carbide)
- Energy Impact Partners (investor)
- Andreessen Horowitz (led Series B)
