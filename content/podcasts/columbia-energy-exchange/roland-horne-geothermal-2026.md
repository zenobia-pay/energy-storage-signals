# Columbia Energy Exchange: From Hot Rocks to Clean Power - Roland Horne on the Future of Geothermal

**Host:** Bill Loveless
**Guest:** Roland Horne (Professor, Stanford University; Director Geothermal Program)
**Date:** 2026

## Key Topics
- Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)
- Fervo Energy and horizontal drilling
- FORGE DOE project
- Geothermal cost reductions

## Key Points
- EGS has been "30 years away since 1975" - now finally arriving
- Drilling costs reduced by ~50% in recent years
- California produces 6% of electricity from geothermal (40+ years)
- Nevada produces 10% of electricity from geothermal
- Technology borrowed from fracking/horizontal drilling in oil & gas
- Geothermal could be competitive in 90% of the US with current drilling costs

## Companies/People Mentioned
- Fervo Energy (Tim Latimer, Jack Norbeck - Stanford alumni)
- Stanford University Geothermal Program
- FORGE (DOE project, Utah)
- Unical (historic geothermal producer, acquired by Chevron)
- Los Alamos National Lab (invented EGS concept 1970s)
