Abstract:
With the growing global emphasis on sustainability and the implementation of contemporary environmental policies, the penetration of renewable energy sources has significantly increased --primarily due to their inexhaustible nature. In this context, integrating photovoltaic (PV) modules with energy storage systems offers a means to mitigate the inherent variability of solar energy. This paper proposes an optimal methodology for power management and market bidding strategies tailored to PV power
