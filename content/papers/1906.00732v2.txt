Abstract:
We study a cloud storage operator who provides shared storage service for electricity end-users using the residual part of a multi-service grid-scale battery primarily used for high priority grid services. We design an optimal product offering, pricing and customer portfolio. A framework and solution approach for assessing and operating such multi-service battery operations with stochastic services and different priority levels is an open problem is proposed. The methodology consists in modellin
