Abstract:
Combining revenue streams by providing multiple services with battery storage systems increases profitability and enhances the investment case. In this work, we present a novel optimisation and control framework that enables a storage system to optimally combine the provision of primary frequency control services with peak shaving of a consumption profile. We adopt a dynamic programming framework to connect the daily bidding in frequency control markets with the longer term peak shaving objectiv
