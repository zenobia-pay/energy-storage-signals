Title: State of the Art Development on Solid-State Lithium Batteries

Authors: L. J. Zhang

Abstract:
Solid-state lithium batteries (SLBs) offers a promising avenue for the development of next-generation lithium-ion batteries with ultrahigh energy density and safety performance. This review provides a quick overview of the state-of-the-art development of anode, cathode, solid electrolyte of SLBs and the observation of ion transport in the cell during the past half year in 2023. Other important developments for SLIBs such as high safety and performance strategies have also been provided.
