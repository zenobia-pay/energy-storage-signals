Abstract:
The market quest for fast-charging, safe, long-lasting and performant batteries drives the exploration of new energy storage materials, but also promotes fundamental investigations of materials already widely used. Presently, revamped interest in anode materials is observed -- primarily graphite electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. Here, we focus on the upper limit of lithium intercalation in the morphologically quasi-ideal highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), with a LiC$_6$ stoichiometry
