Abstract:
The rapid pace of replacing fossil fuel propelled transport by electric vehicles is critically dependent on high-performing, high energy density and efficient batteries. Optimal and safe use of existing battery cells and development of much-needed novel battery chemistries and geometries require a large range of diagnostic and monitoring tools. While structural and chemical information is readily extracted through a host of imaging techniques, non-invasive functional detection of interior batter
