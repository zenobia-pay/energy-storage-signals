Abstract:
By modeling the uncertainty of spinning reserves provided by energy storage with probabilistic constraints, a new optimal scheduling mode is proposed for minimizing the operating costs of an isolated microgrid (MG) by using chance-constrained programming. The model is transformed into a readily solvable mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation in GAMS via a proposed discretized step transformation (DST) approach and finally solved by applying the CPLEX solver. By properly setting the
