Abstract:
Lithium-ion battery systems have been used in practical power systems for peak-shaving, demand response, and frequency regulation. However, a lithium-ion battery is degrading while cycling and would be scrapped when the capacity reduces to a certain threshold (e.g. 80%). Such scrapping criterion may not explore the maximum benefit from the battery storage. In this paper, we propose a novel scrapping criterion for peak-shaving energy storage based on battery efficiency, time-of-use price, and arb
