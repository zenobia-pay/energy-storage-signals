Abstract:
This paper proposes and experimentally validates a joint control and scheduling framework for a grid-forming converter-interfaced BESS providing multiple services to the electrical grid. The framework is designed to dispatch the operation of a distribution feeder hosting heterogeneous prosumers according to a dispatch plan and provide frequency containment reserve and voltage control as additional services. The framework consists of three phases. In the day-ahead scheduling phase, a robust optim
