Abstract:
This paper proposes a novel set of power constraints for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), referred to as Dynamic Power Constraints (DPCs), that account for the voltage and current limits of the BESS as a function of its State of Charge (SOC). These constraints are formulated for integration into optimization-based BESS scheduling problems, providing a significant improvement over traditional static constraints. It is shown that, under mild assumptions typically verified during practical o
