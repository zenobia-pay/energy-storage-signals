Abstract:
As digitization increases, the need to automate various entities becomes crucial for development. The data generated by the IoT devices need to be processed accurately and in a secure manner. The basis for the success of such a scenario requires blockchain as a means of unalterable data storage to improve the overall security and trust in the system. By providing trust in an automated system, with real-time data updates to all stakeholders, an improved form of implementation takes the stage and
