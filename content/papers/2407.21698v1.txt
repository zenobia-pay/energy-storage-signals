Abstract:
This paper studies the long-term energy management of a microgrid coordinating hybrid hydrogen-battery energy storage. We develop an approximate semi-empirical hydrogen storage model to accurately capture the power-dependent efficiency of hydrogen storage. We introduce a prediction-free two-stage coordinated optimization framework, which generates the annual state-of-charge (SoC) reference for hydrogen storage offline. During online operation, it updates the SoC reference online using kernel reg
