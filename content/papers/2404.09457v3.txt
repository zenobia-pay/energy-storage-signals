Abstract:
Magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) are a potential field for the energy storage of the future but are restricted by insufficient rate capability and rapid capacity degradation. Magnesium-sodium hybrid ion batteries (MSHBs) are an effective way to address these problems. Here, we report a new type of MSHBs that use layered sodium vanadate ((Na, Mn)V8O20 5H2O, Mn-NVO) cathodes coupled with an organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode in Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. During electro
