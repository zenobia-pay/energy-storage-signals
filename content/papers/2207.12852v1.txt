Abstract:
Modern search systems use several large ranker models with transformer architectures. These models require large computational resources and are not suitable for usage on devices with limited computational resources. Knowledge distillation is a popular compression technique that can reduce the resource needs of such models, where a large teacher model transfers knowledge to a small student model. To drastically reduce memory requirements and energy consumption, we propose two extensions for a po
