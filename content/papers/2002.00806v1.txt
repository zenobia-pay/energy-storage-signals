Abstract:
This paper presents the current state of mathematical modelling of the electrochemical behaviour of lithium-ion batteries as they are charged and discharged. It reviews the models developed by Newman and co-workers, both in the cases of dilute and moderately-concentrated electrolytes and indicates the modelling assumptions required for their development. Particular attention is paid to the interface conditions imposed between the electrolyte and the active electrode material; necessary condition
