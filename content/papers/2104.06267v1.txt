Abstract:
In this letter, we model the day-ahead price-based demand response of a residential household with battery energy storage and other controllable loads, as a convex optimization problem. Further using duality theory and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, we derive a sufficient criterion which guarantees non-simultaneous charging and discharging of the battery energy storage, without explicitly modelling it as a constraint
