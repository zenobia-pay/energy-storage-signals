Abstract:
In this paper, a hydrogen-based energy storage system (ESS) is proposed for DC microgrids, which can potentially be integrated with battery ESS to meet the needs of future grids with high renewable penetration. Hydrogen-based ESS can provide a stable energy supply for a long time but has a slower response than battery ESSs. However, a combination of battery and hydrogen storage provides stable energy for an extended period of time and can easily handle the sudden demands and surpluses of the mic
