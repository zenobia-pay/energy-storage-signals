Abstract:
Lithium-ion batteries can last many years but sometimes exhibit rapid, nonlinear degradation that severely limits battery lifetime. In this work, we review prior work on "knees" in lithium-ion battery aging trajectories. We first review definitions for knees and three classes of "internal state trajectories" (termed snowball, hidden, and threshold trajectories) that can cause a knee. We then discuss six knee "pathways", including lithium plating, electrode saturation, resistance growth, electrol
