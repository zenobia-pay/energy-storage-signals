Abstract:
The existing literature on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) predominantly focuses on two main areas: control system design aimed at achieving grid stability and the techno-economic analysis of BESS dispatch on power grid. However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliab
