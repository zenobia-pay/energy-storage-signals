Authors: Hao Tu, Scott Moura, Huazhen Fang

Abstract:
Mathematical modeling of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) is a central challenge in advanced battery management. This paper presents a new approach to integrate a physics-based model with machine learning to achieve high-precision modeling for LiBs. This approach uniquely proposes to inform the machine learning model of the dynamic state of the physical model, enabling a deep integration between physics and machine learning. We propose two hybrid physics-machine learning models based on the approach
