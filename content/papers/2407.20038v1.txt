Abstract:
Electricity storage is crucial for a successful transition towards carbon-neutral energy production.

However, costs remain high and it remains to be shown whether an investment can be profitable. This article addresses this question by modelling a battery storage operating in the German power market. We consider two periods with very distinct price dyn
