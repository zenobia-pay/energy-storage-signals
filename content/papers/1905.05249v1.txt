Abstract:
We report the electrochemical performance of nanostructures of Na$_{0.66}$V$_4$O$_{10}$ as cathode material for rechargeable batteries. The Rietveld refinement of room temperature x-ray diffraction pattern shows the monoclinic phase with C2/m space group. The cyclic voltammetry curves of prepared half-cells exhibit redox peaks at ~3.1 and 2.6~V, which are due to two-phase transition reaction between V$^{5+/4+}$ and can be assigned to the single step deintercalation/intercalation of Na-ion. We ob
