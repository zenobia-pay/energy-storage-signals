Title: Stochastic Economic Dispatch with Battery Energy Storage considering Wind and Load Uncertainty

Authors: Shishir Lamichhane, Anamika Dubey

Abstract:
With the integration of renewable energy resources in power systems, managing operational flexibility and reliability while minimizing operational costs has become increasingly challenging. Battery energy storage system (BESS) offers a promising solution to address these issues. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic economic dispatch with storage (SDED-S) framework to assess the impact of BESS in managing uncertainty. The temporal correlation between wind and load uncertainties is captured, w
