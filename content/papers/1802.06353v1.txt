Abstract:
We consider the mathematical treatment of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations based on a model, proposed in 1972 by J. Newman, in which the coupling between the Lithium concentration, the phase potentials and temperature in the electrodes and the electrolyte of a Lithium battery cell is considered. After introducing some functional spaces well-adapted to our framework we obtain some rigorous results showing the well-posedness of the system, first for some short time and then, by
