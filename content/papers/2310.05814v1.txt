Abstract:
In this paper, a multi-stage model for expansion co-planning of transmission lines, Battery Energy Storages (BESs), and Wind Farms (WFs) is presented considering resilience against extreme weather events. In addition to High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) lines, Multi-Terminal Voltage Source Converter (MTVSC) based High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines are planned to reduce the impact of high-risk events. To evaluate the system resilience against hurricanes, probable hurricane speed (HS)
