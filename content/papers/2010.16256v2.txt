Abstract:
The existence of passivating layers at the interfaces is a major factor enabling modern lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Their properties determine the cycle life, performance, and safety of batteries. A special case is the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a heterogeneous multi-component film formed due to the instability and subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte at the surface of the anode. The SEI acts as a passivating layer that hinders further electrolyte disintegration, which is det
