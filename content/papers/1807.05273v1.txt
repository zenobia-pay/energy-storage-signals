Authors: P. Bose, D. Deb, S. Bhattacharya

Abstract:
A new class of high-performance pyrrolidinium cation based ionanofluid electrolytes with higher lithium salt concentration are developed. The electrolytes are formed by dispersing imidazolium ionic liquid functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles in low conducting, 0.6 M lithium salt doped N-alkyl-N-butylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Pyr14TFSI) ionic liquid (IL) hosted electrolyte. Viscosity, ionic conductivity and thermal properties of these electrolytes are compared with well studie
