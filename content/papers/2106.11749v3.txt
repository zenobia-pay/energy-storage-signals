Abstract:
The explosive growth of electric vehicles (EVs) is leading to a surge in retired EV batteries, which are typically recycled despite having nearly 80% available capacity. Repurposing automotive batteries for second-use battery energy storage systems (2-BESS) has both economical and environmental benefits. The challenge with second-use batteries is the heterogeneity in their state of health. This paper introduces a new strategy to optimize 2-BESS performance despite the heterogeneity of individual
