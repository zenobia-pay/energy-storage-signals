Title: Evaluation of Battery Energy Storage System to Provide Virtual Transmission Service

Authors: Qiushi Wang, Xingpeng Li

Abstract:
An immediate need in the transmission system is to find alternative solutions that improve system operation and defer the need for new transmission lines. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance and economic benefits of short-term operation of using battery energy storage systems (BESS) as virtual transmission (VT) to promote power transfer across distant regions. Specifically, this work implements various day-ahead energy scheduling models to analyze the impact of VT on system oper
