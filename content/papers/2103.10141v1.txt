Abstract:
In view of the long-standing controversy over the reversibility of transition metals in Sn-based alloys as anode for Li-ion batteries, an in situ real-time magnetic monitoring method was used to investigate the evolution of Sn-Co intermetallic during the electrochemical cycling. Sn-Co alloy film anodes with different compositions were prepared via magnetron sputtering without using binders and conductive additives. The magnetic responses showed that the Co particles liberated by Li insertion rec
