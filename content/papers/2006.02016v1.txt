Abstract:
Developing applicable two-dimensional (2D) electrode materials with high performance, especially with high ion storage capacity, has become an ever more obsessive quest in recent years. Based on first-principles calculations, we report that T-graphene, a new carbon-based 2D material, has a record-high Li/Na storage capacity. The capacity of T-graphene is as high as 2233.2 mA h g-1 for Li, and can reach 2357.2 mA h g-1 for Na, which are 6 times as much as that of the commercial graphite and are t
