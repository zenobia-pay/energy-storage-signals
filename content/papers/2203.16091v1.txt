Abstract:
Physics-based electrochemical battery models derived from porous electrode theory are a very powerful tool for understanding lithium-ion batteries, as well as for improving their design and management. Different model fidelity, and thus model complexity, is needed for different applications. For example, in battery design we can afford longer computational times and the use of powerful computers, while for real-time battery control (e.g. in electric vehicles) we need to perform very fast calcula
