    "text": "#PublicPower is honoring #BlackHistoryMonth with a tribute to Lewis Latimer (1848–1928), an electrical pioneer known for his numerous inventions, which included an evaporative air conditioner and an innovative process for manufacturing carbon filaments for incandescent light bulbs. The son of fugitive slaves, Latimer had no access to formal education but taught himself mechanical drawing while serving in the U.S. Navy. He went on to become a chief draftsman, patent expert, and inventor. Throughout his career, he collaborated with other scientific pioneers, including Alexander Graham Bell, Hiram Maxim, and Thomas Edison. \n\n✨To learn more, you can purchase the book \"Lewis Latimer: The First Hidden Figure\" by Steve Mitnick from Public Utilities Fortnightly, available in our online store: https://t.co/AKoxMPPx5Y.",
