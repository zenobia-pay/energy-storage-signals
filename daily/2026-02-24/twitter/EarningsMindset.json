    "text": "$IREN IREN Limited: Technical read\n\nPrice action\nAfter the strong rally into the 60+ area, $IREN corrected sharply and is now trading in a sideways range around 40–45. The stock looks to be building a base rather than continuing the downtrend, but upside confirmation is still missing.\n\nKey levels\n\nSupport\n•40–41 – Current consolidation floor where buyers keep stepping in\n•36–38 – Panic flush zone from the recent selloff, strong reaction level\n•32–34 – Major structural support from the prior base\n\nResistance\n•45–47 – Immediate supply zone and range top (needs reclaim for momentum)\n•52–55 – Prior distribution area before the breakdown\n•60–63 – Major resistance from the last peak\n\nRSI\nRSI around 45 suggests neutral-to-weak conditions. Momentum is stabilizing but not yet bullish. A move back above 50 RSI would confirm strengthening buyers.\n\nWhat the tape is saying\nThis looks like a base-building phase after a sharp correction. Volatility compressed and price is holding support, which is constructive. A breakout above 45–47 would likely start the next trend leg, while losing 40 would reopen downside.\n\nMy estimate (opinion)\nNeutral-to-bullish. The structure looks constructive and similar to an accumulation range. Odds favor a move toward 50+ if 45–47 breaks cleanly.\n\nFollow for clean decision maps.

Bulls are now digesting gains with price holding near the upper part of the recent range.\n\nStructure\nV-shaped recovery into a tight consolidation around the mid-$90s. This is a classic “pause after impulse” setup - direction is decided by the next range break.\n\nRSI\nRSI is ~54 (above 50) which supports the bullish bias. It’s not overheated, so there’s room for continuation if price confirms.\n\nKey levels (Support/Resistance)\nSupport\n•92–93: current base of consolidation, buyers defending dips (near-term demand)\n•88–90: prior pivot zone, where the last push up started (first real “line in sand”)\n•84–86: breakdown/reversal area from the prior swing (next downside magnet if 90 fails)\n\nResistance\n•98–100: range ceiling, where supply repeatedly shows up (needs reclaim)\n•104–106: prior distribution area after the spike (likely heavy supply)\n•112–114: major swing supply from the blow-off area\n\nRead-through (trigger + invalidation)\n•Trigger: clean break and hold above 98–100 -> opens 104–106 next\n•Invalidation: lose 92–93 -> likely retest 88–90; lose 90 and the whole bounce starts to unwind\n\nFollow for clean decision maps.
