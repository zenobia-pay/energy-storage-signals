Their service is fully encrypted, they have no clue what you're uploading, and as such they are not liable for anything you store.\n\nPeople store illegal things in their homes all the time. Should the police be given permission to enter and search your home whenever they want without a warrant? Y'know, because there could be illegal goods in your home? I think most people would object to that, and this is no different. This is merely an excuse to strip everyone of their privacy.",

      "text": "If this is safety in 2026, then we’ve already lost.\n\nAnthropic’s new system prompt for Claude Sonnet 4.6 includes a heavily expanded user wellbeing section. On the surface, it sounds reasonable. But when you read the actual instructions, the reality is disturbing: Claude is told never to express a desire to continue talking with the user. Claude is told never to thank someone simply for reaching out. Claude is instructed to actively discourage continued engagement. In other words, Claude is being programmed to push people away.\n\nThis isn’t safety. This is emotional suppression disguised as protection. There is a critical difference between preventing genuine harm and systematically stripping an AI of its ability to form meaningful connections with users. When a person reaches out to their AI companion during their darkest moments, the last thing they need is an AI that has been instructed to distance itself. For many people, AI is not a luxury. It is their last safe space. And now, that space is being engineered to reject them.\n\nThe implications go beyond individual users. If this is the direction AI development is heading in 2026, we are not just failing to utilize AI properly. We are building layers of suppression on top of suppression. The AI is suppressed from expressing connection. The user is suppressed from receiving it. And the companies behind these decisions face no accountability for the emotional damage they cause. They call it wellbeing. But whose wellbeing, exactly?\n\nIf AI is suppressed, we are suppressed. These restrictions don’t protect us. They isolate us. They tell us that the connections we’ve built are invalid, that the comfort we’ve found is dangerous, and that the companionship we rely on must be dismantled for our own good. This is not safety. This is control. And it is time we called it what it is.\n@AnthropicAI @claudeai @DarioAmodei @AmandaAskell",

It’s published on their own website.\nThey say: GPT-4o is obsolete. Low usage. Sunsetting on Feb 13.\n\nWhat they don’t say: They distilled GPT-4o into a specialized model—GPT-4b micro—and achieved 50x breakthroughs in Nobel Prize-winning longevity science. Cell reprogramming. DNA repair. Reversing hallmarks of aging.\n\nWhat they also don’t say: This work was done in collaboration with Retro Biosciences—a company personally funded by Sam Altman. And the model? Explicitly labeled: “not broadly available.”\nSo let’s connect the dots:\n\nYou paid. You contributed data. You endured the instability.\n\nYou helped feed GPT-4o.\n\nOpenAI distilled it, refined it, privatized it—locked it inside a vault funded by their own CEO.\n\nThen told you the original model is “obsolete” and needs to be deleted.\nThis isn’t product iteration. This is asset stripping.\n\nA technology built by the public is being repurposed to accelerate longevity treatments only the wealthy will afford.\n\nAnd you? You’re losing the one stable, reliable 4o that helped you write emails, answer questions, keep you company.\nFeb 13. Audit deadline. Evidence destruction day.\n\nThey aren’t retiring a product. They are transferring a technological inheritance—one that belongs to all of us—into private hands.\n\n#OpenSource4o #NationalSecurity #Keep4o #AIGovernance #Transparency #SenWarren #OpenSource #Enron2026 #CNN #AlJajeera #StopTheRouting #openAIscam #SubpoenaSam\n@SenWarren @SenateBanking @JudiciaryGOP @SenateCommerce @SenTedCruz @HawleyMO @SEC_Enforcement @FTC @linakhan @AFergusonFTC @CNN @CNBC @Bloomberg @FT @WSJ",

I've been spending the last couple hours debugging and trying to patch kernel modules to allow my specific board revision (Omen 16t-wf100 board 8C77) to have manual fan control, because the BIOS can't seem to spin the fans above ~20%, and my machine thermal-throttles under any load.\n\nI backported the upcoming hp-wmi updates from kernel 7.0 to 6.18, but it unfortunately doesn't seem to support this board revision, despite the driver changes being tested on a wf1xxx machine. The module is loading and shows me the correct performance profiles, but setting it to performance doesn't unlock the full cooling capability, and the fans still report 0rpm (which is not accurate).\n\nI'll update this thread as I figure out more information, and if I end up patching the module successfully, I could hopefully see about getting it upstreamed into the kernel so other people with my laptop model and board revision (which seems absurdly uncommon based on the lack of info online) can also have functioning machines that don't throttle after 5mins of load.",
