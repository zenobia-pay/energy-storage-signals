Once resources drain, the pattern targets the next wealthy red state.\n\nWake up, Texas. Stop self-funding the takeover. Texas first - no surrender.",

Doc Pete Chambers embodies the spirit required for such a time as this.\n\nDoc Pete Chambers did not learn leadership from some fancy boardroom or by chasing donor checks. He learned it the hard way as a Green Beret and as a combat surgeon in places where one wrong call meant lives lost. He stood tall when standing was the toughest thing to do. He spoke truth when it burned bridges and cost him everything. A man who knows the cost of freedom because he has paid it in blood and sweat on real battlefields. That is real leadership and the kind of backbone Texas was forged with.\n\nRemember the Alamo!\n\nColonel Travis did not wait for the biggest war chest or the latest poll numbers before he drew that line in the sand. He did not beg for permission or play it safe. He asked for men willing to fight for something bigger than themselves. Ordinary Texans stepped up, driven by conviction, fueled by faith, and motivated by love of home and country. That is the spirit that built Texas (and helped shape the America we need). \n\nToday, we are told that campaigns are won by whoever raises the most money. We are told that power belongs to whoever can buy the most airtime. We tend to forget that this nation was built by people with grit, faith, and an unbreakable will to defend their home. \n\nDoc Pete Chambers has my full endorsement because I know what real leadership looks like.\n\nVote for Doc Pete Chambers for Governor of Texas on March 3rd.\nhttps://t.co/qbvjkWpHvB",
