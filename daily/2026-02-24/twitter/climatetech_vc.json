In just one year since launching, Sightline has grown to over 70 international customers across leading corporates, financiers, and governments—including HSBC, Southern Company, BHP, Galvanize Climate Solutions, and the US Department of Energy.\nThis fundraise comes at a critical moment in the transition—as more than ever, companies and investors need trusted information and a clear line of sight to build competitive strategies and deploy capital. The new funding will be used to expand Sightline’s AI-powered tools, empowering customers with the actionable intelligence needed to compete and win in the transition that is rapidly transforming energy, transport, and industry.\n\nRead more here: https://t.co/U4GKlsrjAn\n\n#EnergyTransition #ClimateTech #FundingAnnouncement #AI #MarketIntelligence",
