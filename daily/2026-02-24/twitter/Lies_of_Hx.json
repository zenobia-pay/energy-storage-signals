      "text": "A man in his 40s begins to notice a little blood in his stool.\n\nHe has no other symptoms but is concerned and decides to see his PCP.\n\nPCP diagnoses him with hemorrhoids and refers him to a GI specialist.\n\nThe GI doctor performs a colonoscopy, finds a small mass, and does a biopsy. The results claim the mass is malignant.\n\nThe man is told that the mass could be very aggressive and he needs to see an oncologist immediately. The GI doctor sends out a referral to oncology.\n\nThe man calls the oncologist to make an appointment and says it's urgent. The oncologist can't see him for almost two months.\n\nThe man calls other oncologists who also have the same timeframe for new patient appointments.\n\nHe makes an appointment and waits.\n\nHis day finally comes to see the oncologist who tells him that his cancer is so aggressive that if he wants to live, he either needs chemo & radiation or surgery.\n\nThe GI doctor and the oncologist both claim the cancer is \"aggressive\" yet it took two months just to get in and be seen to talk about options.\n\nThis oncologist is someone he's never met before, someone his own doctor doesn't even know, someone he's supposed to trust with his life, and he's telling this man to poison his body or undergo a surgery that will require him to have a colostomy bag for the rest of his life.\n\nThe oncologist uses death as a fear factor to get this man to agree to toxic expensive treatments.\n\nSince the man is young and very active, he wants to avoid surgery, so he chooses treatment.\n\nHe undergoes chemotherapy and radiation. His wife drives him back and forth to his treatment appointments twice a week for six months.\n\nIt poisons his body, kills his immune system, and he feels sick all the time. He doesn't have the energy to spend time with his family or even work. \n\nAfter he's completed all treatments, he goes in to see his oncologist again for a follow-up.\n\nThey do another colonoscopy. \n\nIt shows the mass is still there and it's still the same size as it was when he first had a colonoscopy eight months prior.\n\nHe's been poisoning his body and spending tens of thousands of dollars just to find out the mass hasn't changed.\n\nWhat does the oncologist say?\n\n\"It may not have changed, but at least the chemo and radiation prevented it from growing.\"\n\nThe man is furious wondering if the mass was even malignant to begin with. But, the oncologist claims that the mass is still there and it's still aggressive.\n\nThe man ends up getting surgery to remove the \"aggressive mass.\"\n\nAll that time, all those toxic poisons, all that money spent to avoid surgery, and he ended up getting surgery anyway.\n\nMy questions would be:\n\nWas there even a mass at all?\n\nIf so, and it didn't change, it hadn't even grown from the time he first had the colonoscopy to the two months it took to even see an oncologist and start treatment, was it actually \"aggressive\" like they said it was?\n\nSince it didn't even change from all that chemo & radiation, was it really malignant or was it benign?\n\nI'm starting to wonder if some of these cancer diagnoses are false positives and these oncologists are full of 💩",
