# ESS Supply Chain Signal Briefing — Week of Feb 24, 2026

**Lens:** Energy storage development in the US, and how it's impacted by policy, data center demand, utility demand, tariffs, and how to best respond as a supply chain manager for an ESS company.

---

## This Week's Headline

SEIA dropped the big number: **57.6 GWh installed in 2025** — 4x what was installed three years ago. Storage prices fell again.

## Data Center Demand

The dominant demand driver. Hyperscalers are signing multi-GW contracts and FERC is scrambling to figure out interconnection. But political backlash is growing.

## Grid & Utility Demand

Batteries are proving their value for reliability, transmission deferral, and cost.

- [@CanaryMediaInc: "Texas has quietly built a massive renewable energy and battery storage fleet. Its impact is clear in three years of winter storm stability"](https://twitter.com/CanaryMediaInc/status/2024670928731320600) — 60 RTs, by @TamHunt (Feb 20)

## MISO Reliability Fight

NERC flagged MISO as "High Risk" but multiple experts say it's ignoring tens of GW of planned generation:

- [@SimonMahan via @RKonidena: "MISO ERAS: We've got 18 GW of gas in 2028. NERC: No you don't."](https://twitter.com/RKonidena/status/2017267623562486208) (Jan 30)

## Tariffs & Supply Chain

Active tariff wall (Section 301 BESS 25%, components 25%, critical minerals 25%, graphite anti-dumping 93.5%, solar 50%). FEOC phasing in eliminates IRA credits for Chinese-sourced batteries. SCOTUS struck down IEEPA tariffs but Section 301/232 remain.
