# US Energy Storage Briefing: Market Outlook & Supply Chain Strategy

**Date:** February 24, 2026 | **Classification:** Internal — ESS Supply Chain Leadership

---

## Market Snapshot

US utility-scale battery storage has grown from ~1.5 GW (2020) to **25+ GW operational** (Q1 2026). SEIA reports a record **57.6 GWh installed in 2025 alone** — 4x the volume from just three years prior. Lithium-ion comprises ~98% of deployed capacity. Over **100 GW** sits in interconnection queues nationwide, signaling sustained multi-year demand.

**Top markets:** California (~10 GW), Texas (~5+ GW), Arizona, Nevada, Florida. ERCOT is the fastest-growing market; CAISO remains the largest. Average project duration is trending from 2-hour to **4–8 hour** systems.

## Five Forces Shaping the Market

### 1. Policy & Regulation

| Policy | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **IRA 45X Manufacturing Credit** | $35/kWh for cells, $10/kWh for modules made in US — strongest incentive to onshore production |
| **IRA Domestic Content Bonus** | 40%+ domestic content threshold rising annually; drives reshoring pressure |
| **FEOC Restrictions** | Batteries from China/Russia/N.Korea/Iran ineligible for IRA credits (phasing in 2024–2026) |
| **FERC Order 841** | Storage can now participate fully in wholesale markets across all ISOs |
| **FERC Order 2023** | Interconnection queue reform (first-ready, first-served) — critical for clearing 100+ GW backlog |
| **DOE LDES Earthshot** | Target: 90% cost reduction for 10+ hr storage by 2030 (from ~$350 to ~$35/kWh) |

**Risk:** 13 state AGs are suing over Trump administration termination of DOE energy/infrastructure funding. IRA credit durability is the single largest policy variable for project economics.

### 2. Data Center Demand

Data center load is the **dominant new demand driver** for grid capacity. Key signals from this week:

- **Evergy signed 1.9 GW** of contracts with Google, Meta, and Beale Infrastructure (Feb 2026)
- **PPL raised capex 15% to $23B**, with a PPL-Blackstone JV in talks with hyperscalers
- **Heron Power raised $140M** (a16z-led) for solid-state transformers targeting solar farms and data centers
- **Redwood Materials** (JB Straubel) pivoting toward data center energy storage
- Wood Mackenzie warns AI power demand is **colliding with gas turbine supply bottlenecks**
- Six US states are exploring curbs on data center growth over ratepayer bill impacts

**Implication for ESS:** Data centers need firm, dispatchable power. Storage paired with solar/wind is the fastest path to new capacity — and the only one that avoids 3–5 year gas plant lead times.

### 3. Utility Demand & Grid Stress

- Rising electricity prices outpacing standard inflation across most US markets
- **Texas** has proven battery+renewables stabilize winter storm performance (3 consecutive years)
- **Maine** deploying large-scale BESS for clean power goals
- Xcel Energy (Minnesota) proposing new distribution-level storage program model
- Jupiter Power demonstrating batteries can **defer billions in transmission upgrades**
- MISO facing 18 GW of new generation needs by 2028; NERC flagging reliability risks

### 4. Tariffs & Trade

| Tariff | Rate | Target |
|--------|------|--------|
| Section 301 — BESS from China | **25%** (by 2026) | Grid storage batteries |
| Section 301 — EV batteries | **25%** | Li-ion EV cells |
| Section 301 — Battery parts | **25%** | Components |
| Section 301 — Critical minerals | **25%** | Graphite, lithium, cobalt from China |
| Anti-dumping — Graphite electrodes | **93.5%** (preliminary) | Chinese graphite |
| Section 232 — Steel/Aluminum | **25%/10%** | Enclosures, racking |
| UFLPA | Import ban | Xinjiang-linked supply chains |
| Section 301 — Solar cells | **50%** | Chinese solar cells |

**SCOTUS just struck down IEEPA tariffs** (reciprocal + "fentanyl" tariffs on China/Canada/Mexico). Materials-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper remain. Climate tech VC reports US tariffs on Chinese Li-ion cells now total **+64.5%** across all provisions.

**Supply chain offsets:** Chile (signed), Japan (signed), and EU (negotiating) critical minerals agreements enable IRA credit eligibility for non-China sourcing.

### 5. Technology & Competition

- **LFP dominates** utility-scale deployments (cost advantage over NMC)
- **Sodium-ion** emerging for stationary applications (no lithium/cobalt dependency)
- **Long-duration:** Form Energy deploying first commercial iron-air; ESS Inc. acquired VoltStorage; Hydrostor (compressed air) securing California CCA contracts
- **Bankability shifting** from installed-capacity metrics to operational-performance metrics
- **Grid-forming inverters** increasingly required by ISOs for stability services

## Supply Chain Manager Playbook

**Diversify sourcing immediately.** The 25% Section 301 tariff on BESS from China is active. FEOC rules eliminate IRA credits for Chinese-sourced batteries. Prioritize suppliers in:
- **South Korea** (LG, Samsung SDI, SK On) — FTA-aligned, IRA-eligible
- **Japan** (Panasonic) — critical minerals agreement in place
- **US domestic** (Redwood Materials recycling, emerging cell plants) — qualifies for 45X credits
- **Chile, Australia, Canada** — critical mineral sourcing for IRA compliance

**Lock in long-lead components now.** Gas turbine supply is constrained (Wood Mackenzie), and transformer lead times exceed 2 years (70%+ of US distribution transformers are 30+ years old). Steel/aluminum tariffs persist. Secure enclosures, switchgear, and power electronics early.

**Target data center co-location.** This is the highest-margin, fastest-growing segment. Hyperscalers (Google, Meta, AWS) are signing multi-GW contracts. Position solar+storage packages for behind-the-meter or front-of-meter data center applications.

**Pursue IRA credits aggressively.** Stack 45X manufacturing ($35/kWh cells + $10/kWh modules) with domestic content bonuses. This can offset 15–25% of system costs and is the primary competitive moat against Chinese imports.

**Monitor two wildcards:** (1) IRA credit durability under current administration — any clawback restructures project economics entirely; (2) SCOTUS tariff ruling fallout — IEEPA tariffs struck down, but Section 301/232 tariffs remain, and a proposed 10% global baseline tariff looms.
