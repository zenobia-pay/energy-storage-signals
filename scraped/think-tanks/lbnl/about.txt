## Overview
The Electricity Markets & Policy (EMP) Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
conducts research on electricity systems, grid interconnection, renewable energy
deployment, and energy storage.

## Location
Berkeley, CA

## Key Research Areas
- Grid interconnection queues and processes
- Utility-scale solar and storage costs
- Wind energy economics
- Distributed energy resources
- Electricity market design
- Policy analysis

## Notable Energy Storage Research

### Interconnection Queue Analysis
EMP tracks and analyzes the national interconnection queue, including:
- Total GW of solar, wind, storage in queues
- Completion rates and withdrawal rates
- Regional variations
- Queue processing times

Key Finding: Over 2,000 GW in US interconnection queues, majority storage+solar

### Cost Benchmarking
- Utility-Scale Solar Cost Benchmark
- Land-Based Wind Market Report
- Storage cost trends and projections

### Grid Integration Studies
- Integration of high penetrations of renewables
- Grid flexibility requirements
- Storage dispatch optimization
