## Recent Tweets on Energy Storage (Selected)

### Oct 22, 2025: Redwood Materials Second-Life Batteries
"Redwood Materials, the biggest battery recycler in the US, has launched Redwood 
Energy, which will gather used batteries & hook them up to power banks to serve 
as grid-scale storage until they're depleted."

Volts episode with CTO on logistics & potential.

### Oct 1, 2025: Hyperscalers and Storage
"The folks at @rewiringamerica have an idea. Hyperscalers desperately need to 
free up grid capacity for data centers, right? Why not let them buy that capacity 
by paying for residential heat pumps & solar/storage systems?"

Episode with Rewiring America and PG&E.

### Sep 24, 2025: Industrial Heat Pumps & Thermal Storage
"Low-temp industry -- beer, paper, food, etc.? It can be decarbonized with 
industrial heat pumps & thermal storage, but it needs policy & incentives."

### Sep 3, 2025: Sodium-Ion Batteries
"Sodium-ion batteries! They are lower in energy density than lithium-ion, but 
cheaper, safer, & made from abundant domestic materials. What are they good for? 
Peak Energy is using them for grid-scale energy storage."

Episode with Peak Energy CEO.

### Jul 16, 2025: Solar+Storage Economics
"The sun doesn't shine at night, but if you add batteries it might as well! 
If you're not closely tracking the industry, you're probably not aware of just 
how cheap solar+storage is getting."

Episode discussing new Ember report.

### Jan 22, 2025: Pumped Hydro Revival
"Pumped hydro is the most common form of energy storage, but there hasn't been 
much built in the US in years. That's about to change, with the coming of a wave 
of 'closed loop' pumped hydro facilities, which do not need rivers or dams."
