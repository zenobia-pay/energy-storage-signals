### Jan 28, 2026: US Storage Deployment Record
"Holy smokes, the US added over 15 GW of #EnergyStorage in 2025, according to 
EIA 860m data. That's more than gas (5.1 GW) and wind (5.8 GW) combined!"

### Jan 28, 2026: Storage as Largest New Capacity
"The largest near term source of new capacity on US power grids is battery 
storage. This past year shows we are deploying at scale. LFG"

### Jan 28, 2026: Policy Needs
"The US just installed 15 GW of storage in 2025! We'll get there without 
additional policy (barring tariff idiocy or widespread permitting roadblocks)"

"For large-scale BESS, mostly its interconnection & accreditation. LDES needs help"

### Jan 15, 2026: Travis Kavulla at Base Power
"Congrats, welcome to the #energystorage policy world! And a huge get for Base, 
they're lucky to have you."
(Travis Kavulla joining Base Power as policy expert)

## Key Themes
1. US storage deployment tracking (EIA data analysis)
2. Storage vs other generation comparison
3. Policy needs: interconnection, accreditation, LDES support
4. Industry personnel movements
5. IRA industrial policy analysis
6. Tariff impacts on storage

## 2025 Deployment Stats (per Jason's analysis)
- Storage: 15 GW (largest category!)
- Gas: 5.1 GW
- Wind: 5.8 GW
