## Recent Tweets on Energy Storage (Selected)

### Jan 29, 2026: High Temperature Heat Storage
"Another high temp heat battery now in operation! 20 MWh-thermal stored at 1800°C 
in ceramic oxide "firebricks". This one from MIT spin-out Electrified Thermal Solutions."

Notes: Jesse is an advisor to Rondo Energy. The concept allows higher temps than 
conventional heat batteries (1800°C vs ~1200-1500°C), enabling applications like 
steel making or cement calciners.

### Jan 25, 2026: Multi-Day Storage Solutions
"One plausible solution I think is on-site liquid fuel storage... Liquid fuel is 
remarkably energy dense and easy to store. Could be a fossil diesel with very 
little annual emissions impact or synthetic diesel... Other solutions include 
greater use of geothermal with in-reservoir energy storage and nuclear with 
thermal storage, or other low-cost multi-day storage technologies."

### Dec 31, 2025: Storage Cost Thresholds
"We assess the full possible design space of future storage technology of all types 
and find that costs below $10/kWh (+ sufficient combo of other performance parameters) 
are needed to fully displace new, carbon-free firm generation options in a decarbonized grid."

### Nov 21, 2025: China Battery Export Boom
"Battery export boom: China has exported approximately $60 billion in battery energy 
storage systems and components in the first three quarters of 2025, up 24% from last year"

Comparison: US soy exports $25b, LNG $28.9b, Auto exports $59.2b

### Oct 22, 2024: LCOS Critique
"We should never talk about storage as if it's a source of energy, which is what LCOS 
attempts. If we must, consider the LEVELIZED ARBITRAGE SPREAD, not LCOS. Take the buy 
price out entirely and just focus on arbitrage spread."

### Oct 19, 2024: California Solar+Storage
"A coalition of California farmers and legislators is advancing the Valley Clean 
Infrastructure Plan, granting Westland Water District authority to develop transmission 
lines that will enable 20 GW of solar energy & storage projects on farmlands lacking 
sufficient water supply."

## Key Themes
1. Long-duration energy storage economics
2. Multi-day storage requirements for grid decarbonization
3. Heat storage for industrial applications
4. China's dominance in battery exports
5. Critique of storage valuation metrics (LCOS)
6. Integration of storage with renewables
