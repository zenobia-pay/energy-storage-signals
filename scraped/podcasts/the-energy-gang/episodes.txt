        After numerous attempts, a desperate plea from the governor, and some pot sweeteners to industry, legislators in California finally passed an extension of cap-and-trade to 2030.
It’s a big deal. California is the world’s seventh-largest economy. With Governor Brown vowing to fill in the climate diplomacy vacuum left by Donald Trump, it would have been a huge setback to let cap-and-trade languish. We'll look at the significance.

        To many, France’s ongoing elections are the latest showdown between the liberal world order and a new brand of right-wing populism. That narrative follows a similar path in energy.
France’s elections are pitting nuclear versus renewables, closed markets versus open, and disruption versus protectionism.

## Episode : Is Solar About to Get Screwed or Saved in California?
Date: Fri, 06 Sep 2013 00:11:42 -0000
Duration: 00:46:38
Description: 
        California is a bellwether for the solar industry, which is why a new bill being considered in the state could have wide-ranging impacts around the country.
The state is currently considering a bill that would make significant changes to electricity pricing structures that could eat into the value of solar. But the industry is cautiously backing the bill because it also extends net metering policies. The end result could have equally positive and negative consequences. We'll look at the
