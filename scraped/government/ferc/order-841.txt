  - State of charge
  - Charging/discharging limits
  - Duration limitations
  - Response times

### 4. De Minimis Exemption

## Impact on Energy Storage Industry
- Removed major regulatory barrier to storage deployment
- Enabled utility-scale battery projects in wholesale markets
- Allowed storage to compete with traditional peaking plants
- Created new revenue streams for storage assets

## RTO/ISO Implementation
