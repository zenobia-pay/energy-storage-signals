# FERC Order 2023 - Interconnection Reform
# Issued: July 2023
# Source: https://www.ferc.gov/media/order-no-2023
# Status: Final Rule

## Overview
FERC Order 2023 is a landmark regulatory reform addressing the massive backlog in
the interconnection queue for new generation resources, particularly solar, wind, 
and energy storage projects.

## Key Provisions

### 1. First-Ready, First-Served Approach
- Replaces first-come, first-served study process
- Prioritizes projects that are most ready to proceed
- Requires financial commitments to advance in queue

### 2. Cluster Studies
- Groups projects for more efficient study processing
- Reduces redundant analysis
- 150-day initial study timeline

### 3. Financial Commitments
- Study deposits of $5,000/MW or $250,000 minimum for affected systems study
- Commercial readiness deposits of $10,000/MW for network upgrade costs
- Withdrawal penalties to discourage speculative projects

### 4. Timeline Requirements
- 150-calendar-day cluster study
- 150-calendar-day cluster restudy (if needed)
- Facilities study: 90 days (projects ≤25 MW) or 180 days (larger projects)

### 5. Affected System Coordination
- Improved coordination between transmission providers
- Binding cost allocations for affected system upgrades

### 6. Transparency
- Public posting of interconnection study data
- Regular queue status updates

## Impact on Energy Storage
- Critical for clearing backlog of battery storage projects
- Many storage projects withdrawn due to queue delays
- Order expected to accelerate storage interconnection
- Enables co-located solar+storage projects

## Compliance Deadlines
- Transmission providers must file compliance tariffs within 90 days
- Implementation varies by region/ISO/RTO

## Related Orders
- Order 841 (Storage participation in wholesale markets)
- Order 881 (Transmission line ratings)
- Order 1920 (Transmission planning)

## Significance
Order 2023 addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks to clean energy deployment.
As of 2023, over 2,000 GW of generation capacity waited in interconnection queues
nationwide, with average wait times exceeding 5 years. The majority of queued
capacity is solar, wind, and storage.
