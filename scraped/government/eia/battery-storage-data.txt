# Last Updated: 2026-02

## Overview
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) tracks utility-scale battery
storage capacity through Form EIA-860M (Monthly Electric Generator Inventory).

## Key Data Points (as of January 2026)

### Total Operating Capacity
- Approximately 25+ GW of utility-scale battery storage operational
- California leads with ~10 GW
- Texas second with ~5+ GW
- Rapid growth continuing

### Historical Growth
- 2020: ~1.5 GW total
- 2021: ~4 GW total
- 2022: ~8 GW total
- 2023: ~15 GW total
- 2024: ~20 GW total
- 2025: ~23 GW total
- 2026: ~25+ GW (Q1)

### Technology Mix
- Lithium-ion: ~98% of installed capacity
- Other: Flow batteries, sodium, advanced lead-acid (~2%)

### Average Duration
- 2-4 hours typical for utility-scale
- Trend toward longer duration (4-8 hours)

### Top States by Capacity
1. California
2. Texas
3. Arizona
4. Nevada
5. Florida

### Top ISOs/RTOs
1. CAISO - Largest deployment
2. ERCOT - Fastest growing
3. PJM - Eastern interconnection leader
4. SPP - Emerging market

- Annual Energy Outlook
- Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory (Form EIA-860M)
- Battery Storage in the United States: An Update (periodically published)

## Data Access
- Interactive data browser: eia.gov
- Bulk download: API available
- Monthly updates on capacity additions/retirements

## Interconnection Pipeline
- Over 100 GW of battery storage in interconnection queues nationwide
- Many projects paired with solar (hybrid systems)
- Significant withdrawal rates due to queue delays

## Revenue Streams for Storage
- Energy arbitrage (buy low, sell high)
- Ancillary services (frequency regulation, spinning reserves)
- Capacity payments (resource adequacy)
- Transmission/distribution deferral
