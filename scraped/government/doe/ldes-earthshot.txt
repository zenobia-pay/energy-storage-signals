# Status: Active Initiative

## Overview
The Long Duration Storage Shot is one of DOE's "Energy Earthshots" - ambitious
goals to accelerate clean energy technology deployment. It aims to achieve
90% cost reduction for grid-scale long-duration energy storage by 2030.

## Target
Reduce the cost of grid-scale energy storage that provides 10+ hours of
duration by 90% within the decade.
- From ~$350/kWh in 2020 to ~$35/kWh by 2030

## Why Long Duration Storage Matters
- Solar and wind provide cheap electricity but are intermittent
- Current lithium-ion batteries cost-effective for 2-4 hour duration
- Grid-scale decarbonization requires 10-100+ hours of storage
- Enables reliable 100% clean electricity systems

## Technology Pathways
1. Advanced Battery Chemistries
   - Flow batteries (vanadium, iron, zinc-bromine)
   - Metal-air batteries (iron-air, zinc-air)
   - Sodium-sulfur batteries
   - Sodium-ion batteries

2. Mechanical Storage
   - Compressed air energy storage (CAES)
   - Liquid air energy storage (LAES)
   - Gravity storage systems
   - Underground pumped hydro

3. Thermal Storage
   - Molten salt
   - Concrete/rock thermal storage
   - Ice/cold storage

4. Hydrogen
   - Green hydrogen production via electrolysis
   - Underground hydrogen storage
   - Fuel cell reconversion

5. Chemical/Other
   - Power-to-gas
   - Carbon-based fuels

## Key DOE Programs Supporting LDES
- Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E)
- Office of Electricity Energy Storage Program
- Loan Programs Office (LPO)
- Grid Deployment Office

## Major Investments
- $505 million for long-duration demonstration projects (2023)
- Grid Storage Launchpad (PNNL) - $125 million facility
- ARPA-E Duration Addition to electricitY Storage (DAYS) program

## Companies Working on LDES
- Form Energy (iron-air batteries)
- ESS Inc. (iron flow batteries)
- Ambri (liquid metal batteries)
- Energy Vault (gravity storage)
- Malta Inc. (thermal storage)
- Eos Energy (zinc-based batteries)
- Hydrostor (compressed air)

## Metrics for Success
- Cost: $/kWh for storage capacity
- Efficiency: Round-trip efficiency >70%
- Lifetime: 20+ year operational life
- Safety: Non-flammable, non-toxic preferred
- Scalability: Can deploy at GW scale

## Current Status (2026)
- Form Energy deploying first commercial iron-air projects
- Flow batteries seeing increased deployment
- Costs declining but 90% reduction goal ambitious
- Several technologies approaching commercial viability
