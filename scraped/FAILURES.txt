- Any Cloudflare-protected sites

### Priority 2: Add PDF Extraction
- FERC Order PDFs
- DOE reports
- NREL/LBNL publications

### Priority 3: Complete Twitter Scraping
- Run through all 100+ accounts in twitter-accounts.jsonl
- Use search queries for each: "from:handle storage OR battery"

### Priority 4: Find Working RSS Feeds
- Search Apple Podcasts for RSS feed URLs
- Try podcast hosting platforms (Libsyn, Anchor, etc.)
- Use podcast index APIs
